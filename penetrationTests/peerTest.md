## Summary
There were some surprisingly easy attacks that were availible on our websites, even when we created things with security in mind, multiple vulnerabilities were still present. Even with limited knowledge it was easy to create multiple attacks that had devistating results. Both of us attempted to learn about SQL injection to defend against strong attacks, but it is surprisingly difficult to learn about since it's illegal. Luckily, the database is set up in a way that prevents most SQLi attacks. Our favorite attack was Evan's "free pizza" attack. 
Securing these vulnerabilities often was extremly easy, but locating them took a lot of time and effort. Tools like Burp Suite greatly improved the ease of attack, and the discoverablity of such vulnerabilities. Penetration testing was super important to learn about these attacks and vulnerabilities.
